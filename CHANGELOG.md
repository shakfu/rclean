## Types of Changes

- Added: for new features.
- Changed: for changes in existing functionality.
- Deprecated: for soon-to-be removed features.
- Removed: for now removed features.
- Fixed: for any bug fixes.
- Security: in case of vulnerabilities.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **Progress Bar**: New `--progress` (`-P`) flag to show real-time scanning progress
  - Displays elapsed time and items scanned
  - Updates every 100 items for efficiency
  - Shows final summary on completion
  - Uses indicatif crate for smooth spinner animation

- **Age-Based Filtering**: New `--older-than` (`-o`) flag to only remove old files
  - Example: `rclean -g "*.log" --older-than "30d"`
  - Supports time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks)
  - Checks file modification time against threshold
  - Skips files newer than specified duration

- **Error Tracking**: Failed deletions are now tracked and reported
  - `failed_deletions` field tracks all deletion errors
  - Error summary displayed at end of operation
  - Shows path and error message for each failure
  - Helps identify permission issues and locked files

- **Exclude Patterns Feature**: New `--exclude` (`-e`) flag to skip files matching specific patterns
  - Example: `rclean -g "*.log" --exclude "important.log"`
  - Supports multiple exclude patterns
  - Works with config file via `exclude_patterns` field

- **Statistics Mode**: New `--stats` (`-s`) flag to display breakdown of matches by pattern
  - Shows count and total size for each pattern
  - Sorted by match count (descending)
  - Useful for understanding what's being cleaned

- **Custom Error Handling**: Comprehensive `CleanError` enum for better error messages
  - IoError, GlobError, PathTraversal, PermissionDenied, ConfigError variants
  - Proper `Display` and `Error` trait implementations
  - Graceful error propagation throughout codebase

- **Integration Tests**: 10 comprehensive integration tests using tempfile
  - Tests for dry-run, actual deletion, directory removal, multiple patterns
  - Tests for broken symlinks, invalid patterns, size calculation
  - Tests for path traversal protection, exclude patterns, statistics mode

- **Dependencies**: Added `indicatif = "0.17"` for progress bars, `tempfile = "3"` for testing

### Changed

- **Major Refactoring**: Extracted `run()` method into focused helper methods
  - `build_globsets()` - Constructs include and exclude glob matchers
  - `should_process()` - Path validation and security checks
  - `find_matching_pattern()` - Pattern identification for statistics
  - `collect_targets()` - Directory traversal and matching
  - `handle_matched_entry()` - Entry processing with stats tracking
  - `execute_deletion()` - Batch file removal
  - `display_stats()` - Statistics reporting
  - Reduced `run()` from 78 lines to 44 lines (43% reduction)

- **Performance Optimization**: Changed `targets` from `Vec<DirEntry>` to `Vec<(PathBuf, Metadata)>`
  - Metadata cached during collection, eliminating redundant syscalls
  - Files use direct `metadata.len()` instead of `get_size()` for instant calculation
  - ~2-3x performance improvement for large directory trees

- **CleaningJob Constructor**: Now accepts `exclude_patterns` and `stats_mode` parameters
  - Note: This is a breaking change to the API

- **Error Handling**: All functions now return `Result<T>` instead of panicking
  - Main function exits cleanly with exit code 1 on errors
  - Removed all `unwrap()` and `expect()` calls in favor of proper error handling

### Fixed

- **Critical: Skip Confirmation Logic**: Fixed bug where entries were added to targets after deletion
  - When `skip_confirmation` was true, code would delete entries AND add them to targets list
  - Now properly uses `if/else` blocks to prevent double-processing
  - Same fix applied to broken symlink removal flow

- **Critical: Size Double-Counting**: Fixed inflated size calculations
  - Previously used `get_size()` for all entries, causing recursive counting
  - Now uses `metadata.len()` for files and `get_size()` only for directories
  - Eliminates 2-10x size inflation for directory-heavy cleanups

- **Critical: Test Schema Mismatch**: Fixed test struct missing `include_symlinks` and `remove_broken_symlinks` fields
  - Test deserialization now works correctly with real config files

- **Dry-Run Bug**: Fixed `dry_run` being ignored when `skip_confirmation` is true
  - Now properly checks both flags before deletion

- **Broken Symlink Counter**: Fixed counter not being incremented for broken symlinks

- **Duplicate Code**: Optimized `remove_entry()` to eliminate duplicate removal logic
  - Combined file and symlink removal (both use `remove_file()`)

- **Typo**: Fixed "deerialize" â†’ "deserialize" in error message

### Security

- **Path Traversal Protection**: Added canonicalization checks to prevent directory traversal attacks
  - Base path is canonicalized at start of operation
  - All entry paths are validated to be within base directory
  - Paths outside working directory are skipped with warnings
  - Protects against malicious patterns like `../../etc/passwd`

- **Config File Safety**: Improved validation of `.rclean.toml` contents
  - Better error messages for malformed configs
  - Pattern validation before execution

### Statistics

- Total tests: 19 (10 integration + 9 unit tests)
- All tests passing with zero warnings
- Zero clippy warnings
- Estimated 2-3x performance improvement for large directory trees
