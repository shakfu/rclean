A code cleanup script in rust. This was referenced and improved in a stack-overflow [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76797185/how-to-write-a-recursive-file-directory-code-cleanup-function-in-rust)

There's a python script `clean` in `scripts` which is a mature script to
accomplish code cleanups. The intention is for the rust version to provide features like the python script and more.
